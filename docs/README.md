# AVA User Guide

![UI](Ui.png)

AVA is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
If you can type fast, AVA can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

AVA has the personality of a helpful young woman.
